                        <br>not charmed nor intrigued. Then I
                        <br>think 2 myself "What can I offer her?"
                        <br>The tears warm my eyes and blur my
                        <br>vision. I stick 2 my stance of bravado
                        <br>and give her the same uninteresed look
                        <br>she gave me. She was so beautiful
                        <br>But what can I offer her.

                        <br>and if there be pain I know that at least I gave my all
                        <br>and it is better 2 have loved and lost than 2 not love at all
